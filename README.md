This are my dotfiles. I use mac and I mainly do PHP/Javascript development on MacVim.

## Prerequisites

-   GIT
-   Bash
-   MacVIM works best for the color schemes

## Features

-   Code formatting : Using Prettier to format code on saving.
-   Syntax Highlighting : Nice syntax for React/Javascript, PHP and other languages.
-   Color Schemes: Tons of color schemes provided by `flazz/vim-colorschemes`, also my custom theme called `blanco`.
-   Fuzzy Search Files: Type partial filenames and/or paths to quickly find files in your project.
-   File System Explorer: Browse and view the files and folders in your project.

## Install

Run this command to set up VIM:

```
./vim-setup.sh
```
## Quick Commands
-   `Ctrl + p` = To start fuzzy searching a file
-   `Ctrl + n` = To open file system explorer
